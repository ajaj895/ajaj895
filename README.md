### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github profile! My name is Evan, and my education is in Computer Science but I specialize in IT. 
My profile is a collection of projects from school, and personal projects of mine that I work on as a hobby. I have the tendency to start more projects
before I am finished with others. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

* ADS-B Decoding (Java)
* Homelab/Sys Admin
* Microcontroller Projects (C++ or Python)
* Software Defined Radio Stuff
* Website Work (HTML/CSS/JS)
* Rocketry

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

* More Java...
* HTML/CSS/Javascript
* Prototyping with Microcontrollers
* C++/Python/Micropython
* Radio Stuff
* Home Lab Setup and System Administration with Proxmox 

âš¡ Fun fact: 

Rocketry is pretty cool.

Thanks for reading me!
